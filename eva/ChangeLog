    reusing them)
  * memory leak in local socket-addresses.
  * add eva-analyze-successive-memdumps
  * fix eva_escape functions properly handle situations

    eva_http_content_set_idle_timeout(): adjust the keepalive timeout

eva (1.0.60)

    implement '%s' ourselves instead of using strftime.

eva (1.0.59)
  * add eva_log_rotate_stdio_logs()

eva (1.0.58)
  * add eva_http_client_propagate_content_read_shutdown();
    use it from evaurltransferhttp.

eva (1.0.57)
  * evastreamconnection: use read_buffer on input stream if available.
  * BUG: eva_http_request_parse_cgi_string() (and friends).
    Skip past multiple '&' characters as intended.
  * obey "mask" in eva_log_trap()

eva (1.0.56)

eva (1.0.55)
  * add eva_lock_dir()

eva (1.0.54)
  * add eva_http_content_type_parse() function
  * permit eva_io_set_gerror to specific a non-EVA domain (remove assertion)


eva (1.0.53)
  * eva_date_parse_timet() assert failed on some bad dates.

eva (1.0.52)
  * bug fix: eva_date_parse_timet() had a sign-error in its timezone
    handling.
  * add eva_buffer_append_repeated_char().

eva (1.0.50) NOT YET RELEASED

eva (1.0.49)
  * avoid using gettimeofday() if a suitable CPU timer is available.
  * evapassfd: mechanism for passing file-descriptors between processes.

eva (1.0.48)
  * eva_zlib_inflator_new2() and
    eva_zlib_deflator_new2() allow you to use gzip compression
    and decompression.  These require zlib >= 1.2.0 to work right.

eva (1.0.47)
  * EvaStreamWatchdog: a stream that closes automatically after
    a certain amount of inactivity.
  * eva_hook_set_poll(), etc: call the set_poll function even
    if idle notification is enabled.

eva (1.0.46)
  * micro bug fix.

eva (1.0.45)
  * major fix in HttpServer if not enough data comes in.
  * EvaIO::print_errors.  Setting this flag in a EvaIO
    should print all errors that occur.  The default
    is FALSE, but if EVA_PRINT_ERRORS=1 in the environment,
    then the default will become TRUE.

eva (1.0.44)
  * minor possibly bug in HttpClient.

eva (1.0.43)
  * eva-throttle-proxy: --{half,full}-shutdowns options
  * http-client bug fixes: was forgetting to clear a write
    block in several key places.

eva (1.0.42)
  * eva-throttle-proxy: useful for testing.
  * suppress warnings on http-server "X-Whatever" headers.

eva (1.0.41)
  * eva_main_loop_add_timer(), eva_source_adjust_timer()
    take 64-bit arguments for the time in milliseconds,
    so that we can handle really long timeouts.
    (the old limit was 2^32 ms == 48.5 days)
    (Additionally hacks were added for binary compatibility)
  * eva_socket_address_new_local() is deprecated in favor of
    eva_socket_address_local_new().  Likewise,
    eva_socket_address_new_ethernet() is deprecated by
    eva_socket_address_ethernet_new().
  * EvaSocketAddressSymbolic, a symbolic address
    which can be used with eva_stream_fd_new_from_symbolic_address()
    or eva_stream_new_connecting(), which will handle a
    native or symbolic address without burdening the user.
  * EvaPersistentConnection is implemented in terms
    of EvaSocketAddressSymbolic, and its DOING_NAME_RESOLUTION state
    is now unused.

eva (1.0.40)
  * minor bug fix (in rbtreemacros)

eva (1.0.39)
  * minor bug fix.

eva (1.0.38)
  * keep-alive improvements

eva (1.0.37)
  * randomize DNS results to support roundrobin DNS;
    enabled by default.
    Implement eva_dns_rr_cache_roundrobin()
    and eva_name_resolver_set_dns_roundrobin().
  * bugs in redirect handling for HTTP Url transfers.

eva (1.0.36)
  * bug fix:  eva_stream_write() on EvaStreamExternal
    was not handling contention properly.

eva (1.0.35)
  * bug fix:  try the nameservers in the order listed in resolv.conf,
    instead of the reverse of that order.
  * Provide EVA_QSELECT()

eva (1.0.34)
  * Provide EVA_QSORT(), a macro-based quicksort. (in evaqsortmacro.h)
  * Provide stack, deque and list macro-based implementations.
    (in evalistmacros.h)
  * Add eva_g_error_add_prefix().

eva (1.0.33)
  * EvaMemPoolFixed bug fix.
  * expose eva/zlib/evazlib.h for its helper functions.

eva (1.0.32)
  * DNS bug fix.

eva (1.0.30)
  * BUG: bogus assertions in evadnsrrcache wrt to the is_deprecated flag.
  * Make DNS warning/debugging messages go to their own log-domain. (Eva-Dns)

eva (1.0.10)

  * BUILD BUG: sometimes -lreadline requires -ltermcap;
    in any event, test linkage.
  * MAJOR BUG: fixes in EvaDnsClient list manipulation.
    The bug caused (under duress)
    "useless DNS message" warnings and segfaults.
  * add eva_memory_source_new_vprintf()
  * automatically delete stale unix-domain sockets if a server tries
    to reuse the path.
  * Change eva_name_resolve() to be deprecated,
    in favor of more correctly named eva_name_resolver_task_new();
    casual, non-cancelling users may use eva_name_resolver_lookup().
  * minor SSL issues
  * Add eva-netcat program, for debugging and as useful example code.

eva (1.0.9)
  * BUG: evahttpserver was creating 0-length chunks which looked
    like EOF chunks.
  * BUG: evamemory was shutting down while returning nonzero.
    i think we decided that that wasn't allowed.
  * add a line-based ring-buffer: EvaLogRingBuffer.
  * add generic logging traps (eva_log_trap_generic)
  * add ring-buffer logging traps (eva_log_trap_ring_buffer)
  * API change: change eva_log_trap_domain_to_file() to take
    the set of log-levels trapped.
  * BUG: evamimemultipart{decoder,encoder} both had serious bugs
  * BUG: zlibdeflator didn't properly "finish" its data.
    zlibinflator wasn't always giving shutdown notification, nor syncing.

eva (1.0.8)
  * allow user to set the DNS cache size
  * build fixes
  * BUG: EvaStreamExternal was busy-looping.

eva (1.0.7)
  * include EvaControlServer/EvaControlClient
    which provide a simple to implement generic control
    interface.  We also provide the eva-control-client
    program which can talk to such a server, in general.
    Therefore, must programs will only need to implement the
    server.  An example server has been added in src/programs.
  * include EvaHttpContent, a content database for implementing
    normal HTTP servers, which usually want to provide different handlers
    for various portions of the path/user-agent/virtual-host space.
  * BUG: EvaStreamExternal: re-fix bug that caused
    stdin and stdout to be nonblocking.
  * evadaemonize provides --foreground and --background options,
    as well as restart-on-segv or assertion failure support.

eva (1.0.6)
  * compiler bug fix
  * bug fixes to evalog.
  * this version was botched.  do not use it.

eva (1.0.5)
  * API change:  EvaPacket now has two addresses: a source and a destination
    instead of a single multi-use address.
  * change EvaNetworkInterfaceSet::num_interfaces to an unsigned.
  * evalog.h:  gmessage-based logging to files, using many domains. (daveb)
  * SHA-256 support in evahash. (daveb)
  * EvaStreamListenerSocket has a parameter to remove the entry
    from the file-system when done.

eva (1.0.4)
  * memory leak in evahttpclient and evahttpserver finalize routines

eva (1.0.1)
  * eva_socket_address_localhost() becomes a macro,
    and more properly named eva_socket_address_loopback()
    is added.  eva_ipv4_ip_address_{any,loopback} globals
    are added, basically fixed as 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. (mrad)
  * Force absolute URLs to have a slash (/) after the host. (daveb)
  * Partial shutdown problem in HTTP client, noticed by Ted Witkamp. (daveb)
  * HTTP Download include query string (twitkamp)
  * shutdown-in-shutdown loop noticed by mrad. (daveb)
  * eva_url_encode and eva_url_encode_http weren't escaping some
    whitespace and other "non-unreserved" characters. (mrad)
  * various solaris fixes reported by Jeremy Leader (at Overture).
  * add eva_timegm() which does the opposite of gmtime() portably. (daveb)
  * better handling of POLLHUP and POLLERR in EvaMainLoop{Poll,Epoll}.
    Now the POLLHUP flag is propagated to G_IO_IN and POLLERR
    is propagated to G_IO_IN|G_IO_OUT.  This is roughly what
    BSD and select(2) do, so it seems right for linux/poll,epoll as well.
  * eva_tree_remove wasn't removing newly inserted keys when a node
    with the same key was already being visited. (mrad)
  * Allow hooks to be safely untrapped/retrapped during notification. (mrad)
  * Allow hooks to defer shutdown notification when the hook is initialized
    with eva_hook_mark_can_defer_shutdown, and the class's shutdown method
    returns false. (mrad)

eva (1.0.0)

  * Completely rewritten to use 'streams' and 'hooks' instead 
    of 'actors'.
